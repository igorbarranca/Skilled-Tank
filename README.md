# Skilled-Tank
 tiny UnityEngine hill climb clone 
Very small Unity Project inspired by the second task of the "Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D Online Course - 2021" from GameDev.tv".

This is an academic project born for starting to increase my programming and UnityEngine skills.

I dealt with: - Scripting - new Unity Input System - 3 different level design - A way of moving betwenn unity scenes and saving/reset the game progress with PlayerPrefs - and more...

The game is uplodaded on Itch.io

Thanks for the time you have dedicated to this. Have a nice day.
